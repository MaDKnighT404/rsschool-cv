## About Me

A year ago, I realized that I could not live without programming.
And every day I am more and more convinced that I made the right choice when I started self-learning in the Front-end field.

## Skills

HTML
CSS/SASS
Git
JavaScript (Basic)


## Code Example

Task: *reverse number*
```
function reverse (num) {
	let str = num + '';
	sign = '';
	if (str[0] === '-') {
	sign = '-';
	str = str.slice(1);
	}
	return console.log(+(sign + str.toString().split('').reverse().join('')));
}
 reverse(-250)
```
